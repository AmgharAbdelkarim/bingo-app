# Bingo application.

## Introduction

Bingo application is Developed using ReactJs

# Project Architecture

The project is written with ReactJs as a View framework.

## React Boilerplate

This project was started using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a boilerplate. To read more about it, please visit [Create react app official documentation](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

### Third party stack

- React rewards lets us add micro-interactions to our app, and rewards users with the rain of confetti, emoji or balloons in seconds. For more, read [here](https://github.com/thedevelobear/react-rewards).
- Classnames is a simple javaScript utility for conditionally joining classNames together. For more, read [here](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames#readme).

### Eslint

Eslint is shipped in by default in react-create-app. However, you can customisize your rules in the `.eslintrc` file. 

I integrated `Prettier` with the project as unifed formatting tool. It automatically format code on save.
